THe code quiz has been formatted to have a user be able to answer 5 questions in 3 minutes. THe user will be able to start the quiz with 4 potentail answers to each question. 

This timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions features a responsive layout, dynamic HTML and CSS powered by my Javascript code all on a clean and polished user interface.
